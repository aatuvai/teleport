Teleport Identity Governance is an add-on to Teleport Zero Trust Access that
allows you to eliminate standing privileges, sync access with organization
changes, and respond to security incidents.

## Access Requests and Access Lists

Just-in-time Access Requests allow Teleport users to request access to a
resource or role depending on need. The request can then be approved or denied
based on a configurable number of approvers. You can use Access Requests to
implement the principle of least privilege in your organization, leaving an
attacker with no permanent admins to target.

[Learn more about Access
Requests](access-requests/access-requests.mdx).

Access Requests are designed to provide temporary permissions to users. You can
grant longstanding permissions to a group of users, with the option to renew
these permissions after a recurring interval.

Learn more about [Access
Lists](access-lists/access-lists.mdx). 

## Identity provider integrations

Teleport Identity Governance integrates with your identity provider so you can
automatically sync permissions with your IdP with permissions in Teleport.

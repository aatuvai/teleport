Teleport helps you secure infrastructure resources such as servers, databases, and Kubernetes clusters by enforcing strong access controls and auditability. Once a resource is enrolled with Teleport, access to it can be managed through the Teleport role-based access control (RBAC) system, allowing you to define which users or teams can connect and what actions they are permitted to perform.  - What resources can a specific user access?
